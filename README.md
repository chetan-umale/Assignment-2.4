Q1-1. Explain hadoop in layman's term.
answer:
1.With the explosion of data, existing technologies became incapable of handling such large amount of data.
2.The most potent challenges were lack of storage and processing power.
3.Hadoop is a framework developed to meet these challenges.
4.Hadoop as such is not a programming language or a piece of hardware.But it is a collection of various components which work in collaboration to effectively handle Big Data.
5.The 2 basic building blocks of hadoop are- HDFS (Hadoop distributed File System) and MapReduce.
6.HDFS handles the storage of data while MapReduce handles the processing of data.
7.These programs are developed to run on commodity hardware which provides an alternative of scaling out whenever there is lack of storage or processing power.
8.Hadoop runs on a cluster of computers and not a single system.Companies like Yahoo,IBM etc. have clusters of more than 10000 computers running continuously to analyze large volumes of Data.
9.The Hadoop cluster work on master-slave architecture.
